# FAQ

- **Can I use this theme in conjunction with another?**
  
  Yes! This theme works best in conjunction with the Forest theme. The other themes sometimes have visual errors.

- **Does this theme still work with older versions of Video.js?**
  
  Yes, but it isn't recommended because several bugs occur in those Video.js versions (that aren't the theme's fault), which can affect its functionality,
  and in versions Video.js 6 and older often breaks the UI.
