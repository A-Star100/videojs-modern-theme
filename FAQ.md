# FAQ

- **Can I use this theme in conjunction with another?**
  
    Yes, but only in versions older than 1.1 before the theme was programmed to work independently.
    If you downgrade, v1.0 works best with the Forest theme, as other themes cause visual errors.

- **Does this theme still work with versions of Video.js older than 8?**

    Yes, but since those versions are so old, bugs occur that affect the theme's functionality.
